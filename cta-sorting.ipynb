    "- so how would we actually analyse the complexity of insertion sort when we saw earlier that the total number of data comparisons which would be made by insertions are two es in fact the number of inversions which we termed d plus at most n minus one comparisons as well so a sorted list would have no inversions and therefore in that case insertion sort would run in linear r omega n time in the best-case and the best-case is of course when the input is already sorted on average a list of size n would have n minus one times n over four inversions and therefore the total number of comparisons would be n minus one plus d so n minus one plus n minus one times n divided by four and thats approximately equal to n squared comparisons on average and then in the worst-case a list of size n would have n minus one times n over two inversions so that would correspond to a reverse sorted input rn and input thats arranged exactly in the opposite order which we want to achieve and that will be the maximum number of versions and the number of comparisons that will be made in that case would be n minus one plus d which is n minus one plus n minus one times n divided by two and that would approximately be equal to n squared are all n squared in the worst-case then sort of compare the simple comparison-based sorting algorithms which weve looked at in this lecture and the main advantage that insertion sort has over selections or for example is that the inner loop will only iterate as long as is necessary to find the insertion point so in the worst-case insertion sort would iterate over the entire source repairs and in this case the number of iterations would be the same as for selection sort therefore the worst-case running time is o n squared and thats the same worst-case running time approximately as selection sort and bubblesort with the same class of of order function at the other extreme if the array is already sorted the inner loop wouldnt need to iterate at all so for this case the running time would be omega n which is the same as the running time of bubblesort on an array which is already sorted so bubble sort selection sort and insertion sort to compare them theyre all in-place sorting algorithms and bubble sort and insertion sort are stable swapping algorithms so they preserve the relative ordering of the elements which are valued the same according to a comparator function so theyre preserved between the unsorted input instance and the sorted output and in comparison to these selections art is unstable so it doesnt make any guarantees about the ordering of elements which have the same value according to a competitor function lets just review the criteria for choosing a sorting algorithm so we had some criteria we mentioned the last day like having a small number of items to be sorted if items are mostly sorted already and we could be concerned about scenarios worst-case scenarios average-case behaviour we could have data thats kind of randomly generated or kind of drawn from a uniform dense universe and so even distribution and there could be a desire to write as little code as possible are requiring some status marking so in general we see that insertion sort is actually good for having a small number of items its good in cases where you also have items that are mostly sorted already are a very low number of inversions and its also very easy to call it off and it that it would be as easy to call it up really as selection sort bubble sort but of course it has advantages over those two methods so well see in fact that those criteria which we are going to use to choose sarking algorithms that insertions are can satisfy quite a lot of those so just to recap and bubble sort selection sort and insertion sort are all n squared in the worst-case and theyre all simple sorting algorithms that are that are well known and i suppose bubble sort and selection sort wouldnt be that widely used insertion sort is in certain and specific cases so we have n o n squared and worst-case performance for all of those however it is possible to do much better than this even with comparison-based sorts as well see in the next lecture and we look at specifically their merge sort and quicksort boot from this lecture on the simple all n squared sorting algorithms and the main takeaway points here are that bubblesort is extremely slow and its of little practical use and selection sort is generally better than than bubblesort but still not great and still not really a practical algorithm to use in the real world unless youve got very small input instances and selection sort insertion sort however are good enough for small input instances we could say however the important thing about insertions artists that its usually the fastest of three and in fact as well discuss later for small sizes of n or small input instances so we could say 510 15 elements or something like that insertion sort is usually faster than more complex algorithms and this has in fact led to the use of insertion sort in hybrid sorting algorithms which combined the properties of kind of more complex algorithms which are better guarantees and work better on larger data sets and combining the speed and efficiency of insertion sort on small data sets and once the problem is broken down to a small enough level and so we will talk about hybrid sorting algorithms later as well"
